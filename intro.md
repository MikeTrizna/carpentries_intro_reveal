## Carpentries way of teaching

Code along, rather than lecturing from PowerPoint, or just demonstrating

Odds of running into an error are high, but don’t panic – this is a great opportunity to learn

## ***We won’t leave you behind***

### How to make sure we don't leave you behind

In the real world, we used to use Post-It notes to indicate progress, but for this workshop we'll use the "yes" / "no" buttons in the Zoom Participants panel.

## How to ask questions

The Instructors will try to build in time between lessons to ask questions, but use the Zoom chat for questions that come up during a lesson.
